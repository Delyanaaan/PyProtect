## ❓ FAQs
- **What is obfuscation?** 
  Obfuscation is the process of making your code difficult to understand. This helps to protect it from unauthorized access.

- **Can I reverse the process?** 
  No. Once your code is obfuscated, it cannot be easily reverted to its original format.

- **Is my data safe?** 
  Yes, PyProtect does not store or transmit your files. Your data remains on your device.
